Ex 1: 
Syscall number :
6  *18	//Read  -->Read the command from the command line
1		//Fork	-->Fork the shell for creating another process(called parent process in the following), that will itself create the two processes that will execute the commands
3		//Wait	-->The shell process wait for the command to return
[Switching to thread 1]
13		//Sbrk	-->Allocate more memory for the process
4		//Pipe	-->Create the pipe to allow the two processes to communicate
1		//Fork	-->Fork the parent process for creating another process
26		//Close
11		//Dup	-->Duplicate a file descriptor
1		//Fork	-->For the parent process for creating another one
26	*2	//Close
8		//Exec	-->One of the new process becomes cat
26  *3	//Close
11		//Dup	-->Duplicate a file descriptor
3		//Wait	-->Send the parent process in the wait state
26  *2	//Close	
8		//Exec	-->The other new process becomes wc
20		//Open	-->Open the file myname.txt
6		//Read	-->Read it
21		//Write	-->Send data to the pipe
6		//Read
26		//Close	-->Close the file myname.txt
2		//Exit	-->One of the created processes exit (the one that executed the cat command)
3		//Wait
6   *2	//Read	-->Read from the pipe
21  *?	//Write	-->Write the result on the terminal
2   *2	//Exit	-->The two last created processes (wc & parent process) exits
21  *2	//Write	-|
				 |-Prompt a new command line
6		//Read	-|
//END

Some "close" system calls are used to close the unused terminals of the pipe.
The others unexplained "close" system calls are probably used to close stdin/stdout/stderr file descriptors.
